## Summary

This repository is meant to ease the downloading of Receita Federal CNPJ Dataset (current located on [Dados PÃºblicos CNPJ](https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/pt-br/assuntos/orientacao-tributaria/cadastros/consultas/dados-publicos-cnpj)). As known, Receita's server is very unstable and often makes download connections die or timeout, so to handle this, was used [aria2 download utility](https://aria2.github.io/) with some arguments tweaks for this usage.

## Installation

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This repository depends on aria2 installation. Right now, it is built to be UNIX only, but should receive future updates to allow Windows usage. :heavy_exclamation_mark:

To be able to use the first time, follow the instructions on your Terminal:

1 - Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/athossampayo/ReceitaFederalCNPJDownloader.git

2 - Access directory:

    cd ReceitaFederalCNPJDownloader

3 - Run aria2 installer:

    ./aria2-installer.sh

## Usage

After letting the aria2 installer run, we are good to go:

4 - Run the download script and wait till it completed (will take some time):

    ./download_receita_cnpj_dataset.sh

PS: Script will create an output directory with the last dataset extraction date. Example: /11-09-2021

So, if needed, it's possible to make this script run every month to get updated date or so.
